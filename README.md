# Flipkart Reviews Sentiment Analysis

An end-to-end machine learning project that analyzes Flipkart product reviews to determine sentiment polarity and detect sarcasm in user-generated text.

---

## About

This project provides an automated pipeline for classifying customer reviews into **Positive**, **Neutral**, and **Negative** sentiments. It also incorporates a dedicated **sarcasm detection** module that flags potentially sarcastic reviews, helping improve the reliability of sentiment predictions.

Built with a modular architecture, the system is designed for clarity, maintainability, and ease of extension.

---

## What This Project Includes

- **Sentiment Classification** — Categorizes reviews into Positive, Neutral, or Negative using trained ML models
- **Sarcasm Detection** — Identifies sarcastic reviews with confidence scores using Logistic Regression
- **Model Comparison** — Evaluates Naive Bayes against Logistic Regression to select the best-performing model
- **Interactive Prediction** — Allows users to input custom reviews and receive instant predictions
- **Text Preprocessing Pipeline** — Handles lowercasing, URL removal, punctuation stripping, tokenization, and stopword removal
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** — Converts raw text into meaningful numerical features for model training
- **Visualization Suite** — Generates word clouds, sentiment distribution charts, and confusion matrices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jprem97/VibeLens.git
cd Flipkart-Sentiment-Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This executes the full pipeline — data loading, exploratory analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and launches the interactive prediction interface.

## How It Works

The system follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Loading** — Reads Flipkart review datasets from CSV files
2. **Exploratory Analysis** — Displays dataset shape, missing values, and rating distribution
3. **Label Creation** — Derives sentiment and sarcasm labels from review ratings
4. **Text Cleaning** — Applies a unified preprocessing pipeline to all reviews
5. **Feature Engineering** — Transforms cleaned text into TF-IDF vectors
6. **Model Training** — Trains Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for sentiment; Logistic Regression for sarcasm
7. **Evaluation** — Measures performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
8. **Interactive Prediction** — Accepts user input and returns sentiment and sarcasm predictions

Enter your review:
This phone is amazing.

Predicted Sentiment : Positive
Sarcasm Detected    : Not Sarcastic (Confidence: 85.2%)
